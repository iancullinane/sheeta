# Sheeta

CDK deployment infrastructure can be found here: [link](https://github.com/iancullinane/sheeta-infrastructure)

Cloud bot for discord. Has features for slash commands, direct chat, cloud deployment, and more to come. Everything in various states of progress. This is currently in heavy development. Originally I utilized a websocket approach, but have switched to a lambda. Use caution.

(you don't have to call it Sheeta)
